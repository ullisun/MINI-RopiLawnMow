This is the indoor development platform of my [RoπLawnMow](https://github.com/ullisun/RopiLawnMow) Project

the difference between this project and the RoπLawnMow Project is the drive Script.
In the MINI-RoπLawnMow are brushed Motors installed and for that a different Motordriver is needed.
I will try to make all relevant changes in the driver.py so that only this file as to be exchange later

Copy the robot directory to your Pi. Update the path into the start.sh.
exec the start.sh and call python <your path> mower.py. Should work

Good luck

Please not that this project is under development during winter and spring. After that i will transfer
this code on my [RoπLawnMow](https://github.com/ullisun/RopiLawnMow) Project.
